But for a more elaborate model of action cost, we can introduce an additional `int` of -1 to `state = list[list[int]]`, where the -1 denotes a cell that is both empty and cannot contain a queen. For example, if we place a queen at cell i,j then all cells horizontal, vertical, and diagonal to i,j would be populated with a -1, as they are now in that queen's attacking range (as per chess rules) "
